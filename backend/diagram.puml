To convert the provided user story into a PlantUML workflow diagram, you can use the following PlantUML syntax. PlantUML is used to create diagrams from plain text language, so you'll describe each step and decision point in the system workflow:

```plaintext
@startuml

!define VALID_EMAIL_CHECK actor "Check Valid Email"
!define UNIQUE_EMAIL_CHECK actor "Check Email Uniqueness"
!define REQUIRED_FIELDS_CHECK actor "Check Required Fields"

actor Admin as admin
actor "System" as system

admin -> system: Login with Admin email and password
system -> admin: Shows Employee tab
admin -> system: Navigate to Employee tab
system -> admin: Shows Create Employee Button
admin -> system: Click on Create Employee Button
admin -> system: Fill in employee's information

system -> VALID_EMAIL_CHECK: Check if email is valid
VALID_EMAIL_CHECK --> system: Valid email / Invalid email

system -> UNIQUE_EMAIL_CHECK: Check if email is unique
UNIQUE_EMAIL_CHECK --> system: Unique email / Email already exists

system -> REQUIRED_FIELDS_CHECK: Check required fields
REQUIRED_FIELDS_CHECK --> system: All fields filled / Missing fields

alt All validations passed
    admin -> system: Click on Save Button
    system -> system: Save employee to database
else Any validation fails
    system -> admin: Show appropriate error message
end

@enduml
```

### Explanation:
1. **Actors**: Define the user (Admin) and the systems or checks (for email validity, uniqueness, and required fields).
2. **Steps**: Describe each step taken by the admin and the system, including navigating tabs, clicking buttons, and filling in information.
3. **Validations**: Check processes for email validity, uniqueness, and required fields, shown as separate actors for clarity.
4. **Outcome**: Use the `alt` and `else` keywords to indicate different paths depending on whether validations pass or fail. If all validations pass, the system saves the employee data. If any validation fails, an error message is shown.

This code can be pasted into a PlantUML tool or online editor to generate the diagram.
